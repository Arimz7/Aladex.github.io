              I was planning to move to a house in a short period of time but
              don’t know how, until I met Mr Ajayi of Aladex Realty …. wow! What
              a great agent to deal with. Mr Ajayi was well versed in the areas
              and the type of homes for sale and no matter the time of night, I
              had a question, he would always respond promptly. In one and a
              half months he found me the perfect home with kind of features I
              wanted. I was very fortunate to have Mr. Ajayi. We closed the
              house in less time expected…. thanks to Mr. Ajayi and the team of
              Aladex realtors.

              Mr. Ajayi is a Realtor who cares about his relationship with
              others. When he worked with us over ten years ago, he always asked
              us for feedback on every property we scouted, a courtesy he
              afforded to the other realtors. By so doing, he was able to
              discern, or should I say, discover our unspoken preferences and
              led us to the house that matched our needs. I found him to be
              knowledgeable and attentive. As a trained Economist with higher
              degrees, his sense of property value is precise. He is very
              professional, and his demeanor is respectful. All I have to say
              about him is very positive. I have high regard for him as a person
              and for his work as Realtor.

              I have been looking to buy a house, but don’t know the benefits of
              owning and the process of involved. I was referred to Mr. Ajayi
              through a friend. I can not say enough by Mr. Ajayi wealth of
              knowledge in real estate transactions. Knowing that I am a first
              time home, he took his time to work me through the process and
              always ready to answer questions. I’m indeed very grateful and
              would recommend Mr. Ajayi anytime. I closed my house within a
              month.
